# Hosted demo deployment readiness

Prepare the **static hosted demo** (`apps/web`) for deployment review. This repo does **not** ship a deployment workflow, platform secrets, or live URLs — reviewers configure hosting manually.

**Doc map:** [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md) · **Pre-ship gates:** [RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md](./RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md)

---

## What you are deploying

| Included in hosted build | Not included (local-only) |
| --- | --- |
| Precomputed traces from `data/traces/` (bundled at build time) | Live LLM or agent execution |
| Synthetic eval table from `data/evals/policy_comparison.json` | `pnpm eval:ci` / Python scorers |
| Failure clusters, router fixture, cockpit UI | Local runner (`runs/`), MCP server |
| Client-side policy/task toggles (static JSON replay) | Braintrust / Weave live upload |

**Claims to keep accurate:** static fixtures, synthetic portfolio table, no browser API calls. The hosted page is fully static — no live LLM, runner, MCP, or external APIs in the browser.

---

## Build audit (current Next.js setup)

| Check | Status |
| --- | --- |
| App Router, single static page | Yes — `apps/web/app/page.tsx` prerenders as static |
| API routes / middleware / SSR data fetching | None |
| `process.env` in `apps/web` | None required |
| Fixture imports | `apps/web/lib/*` imports `data/` JSON via relative paths — **full monorepo checkout required at build** |
| Workspace dependency | `@ahe/harness` via `transpilePackages` in `next.config.mjs` |
| Standard `next build` output | Hybrid static + minimal server handlers (Next 14 default); suitable for Vercel/Netlify Next runtime |

`pnpm build` (root) runs `pnpm --filter @ahe/web build`. CI already runs this on every push/PR.

---

## Recommended host: Vercel

**Why:** Native Next.js 14 support, pnpm monorepo-friendly, no `output: 'export'` changes needed, matches current `next build` behavior.

### Suggested project settings

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Framework preset | Next.js |
| Root directory | Repository root (`.`) — **not** `apps/web` alone |
| Install command | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` |
| Build command | `pnpm build` |
| Output directory | *(leave default — Vercel detects Next.js in `apps/web`)* |
| Node.js version | 22.x (matches CI) |
| Environment variables | **None required** |

If the platform insists on **Root directory = `apps/web`**, use install from monorepo root so `data/` and `packages/harness` resolve:

```bash
# Install (from apps/web as root dir)
cd ../.. && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# Build
cd ../.. && pnpm build
```

### Monorepo note

The web app imports fixtures from `../../../data/` and transpiles `@ahe/harness`. Deploying only the `apps/web` folder without the rest of the repo **will fail** at build time.

---

## Alternative hosts

### Netlify

Use the [Next.js runtime plugin](https://docs.netlify.com/frameworks/next-js/overview/) (not plain static file hosting).

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Base directory | Repository root |
| Build command | `pnpm build` |
| Publish directory | Leave to Next.js plugin (typically `apps/web/.next`) |
| Environment variables | **None required** |

Plain “static site” mode (`publish = apps/web/out`) is **not** supported without code changes — this app does not use `output: 'export'`.

### GitHub Pages

**Not recommended without config changes.** GitHub Pages serves static files only. This app uses the default Next.js build (not `output: 'export'`), so there is no `out/` folder to upload.

To use GitHub Pages you would need (out of scope for this repo today):

- `output: 'export'` in `next.config.mjs`
- `basePath` / `assetPrefix` if deploying to `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`
- `images.unoptimized: true` if `next/image` is added later

Document for reviewers: use Vercel or Netlify Next runtime instead.

---

## Local preview (post-build smoke)

After a production build, serve the built app locally (no deploy):

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm preview
```

Opens Next.js production server on port **3000** (override with `PORT=3001 pnpm preview`). This mirrors what Vercel/Netlify run after build — still **static fixture replay**, not live agents.

Development server (hot reload): `pnpm dev`.

---

## Automated HTML smoke (no browser)

`scripts/smoke_hosted_demo.py` fetches the page HTML and checks server-rendered shell signals (title, section anchors, static-demo copy, cockpit/eval/architecture headings, task-class labels). **No Playwright**, no screenshots, no external services.

**Limitation:** validates the Next.js HTML shell only — it does **not** execute client JavaScript or verify policy-toggle interactivity. Use the manual browser checklist below for click-through.

### Local (after preview)

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm preview   # terminal 1 — serves http://localhost:3000
pnpm smoke:hosted:local   # terminal 2
```

Equivalent:

```bash
pnpm smoke:hosted -- --url http://localhost:3000
pnpm smoke:hosted -- --url http://localhost:3000 --timeout 30 --format json
```

`pnpm dev` also works if preview is not running. If port **3000** is occupied or serving a stale build, use a free port after `pnpm build`:

```bash
cd apps/web && npx next start -p 3001
pnpm smoke:hosted -- --url http://localhost:3001
```

### Deployed URL

```bash
pnpm smoke:hosted -- --url https://your-demo.example.com
```

Exit code **0** = all checks passed; **nonzero** = missing required HTML signals or HTTP error.

Not part of CI (requires a running HTTP server). Unit tests mock fetch against a small HTML fixture.

---

## Pre-deploy checklist (local)

```bash
pnpm deploy:check          # deterministic readiness audit
pnpm repo:status           # generated artifacts not tracked
pnpm validate:fixtures
pnpm eval:ci               # optional; not required for static hosting
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
pnpm preview               # terminal 1
pnpm smoke:hosted:local    # terminal 2 — automated HTML smoke
```

`pnpm deploy:check` verifies monorepo layout, fixture paths, no required env vars, and no API routes — it does **not** deploy or call external services.

---

## Post-deploy smoke checklist

### Automated (recommended first)

```bash
pnpm smoke:hosted -- --url https://your-deployed-url.example.com
```

### Manual browser (interactive behavior)

After automated smoke passes, optionally verify in a browser:

1. **Sticky nav** — Why / Protocol / Cockpit / Evals / Architecture jump to `#premise`, `#protocol`, `#cockpit`, `#evals`, `#architecture` without headings hidden under the nav bar.
2. **Cockpit** (`#cockpit`) — default bugfix + baseline shows **Rejected**; trace timeline and evidence tabs populate.
3. **Policy toggle** — switch to **Guarded recovery** on bugfix → **Accepted**, metrics/terminal/diff update together.
4. **Task switch** — adversarial + multi-agent tasks load distinct traces (keyboard `[` `]` optional).
5. **Failure taxonomy** (`#failure-taxonomy`) — **Inspect cluster** opens the same drawer as eval-table red cells.
6. **Failure drawer** — from taxonomy or eval table: click baseline loop or unsafe metric → cluster drawer opens; Escape or backdrop closes.
7. **Offline** — after first load, toggles still work (all data bundled).

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *(none)* | No | Hosted demo has no `process.env` usage in `apps/web` |

Do not add API keys to the hosted deployment. Braintrust, W&B, runner, and MCP remain local developer tools.

---

## What CI validates today

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `pnpm build` but does **not** deploy. Optional local `pnpm deploy:check` complements CI with hosting-specific assertions (fixture paths, env audit).

---

## Intentionally out of scope

- Vercel/Netlify/GitHub Actions deploy workflows
- Platform tokens or project linking
- Custom domains or preview URLs in repo docs
- Converting the app to pure static export for GitHub Pages
- Running Python eval gates on the hosting platform
